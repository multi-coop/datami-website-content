Let's have a look under the hood...

## Vizboard is a widgets collection

Gitribute is a web application providing a serie of "[widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget)". It means that **you could integrate it inside any website**, and you don't have to rely on a centralized website to use any of our widgets.

The term "widget" is equivalent to "web component", it's a way to display an independent dynamic component inside a website. The "widget" approach is similar to the old-fashion _iframe_, but is more flexible and adapted to modern web than iframes.

## Vizboard relies on Git providers

The very difference with proprietary solutions (like GoogleSheet or Airtable) or with equivalent open sourced solutions (like [nocoDB](https://www.nocodb.com/) or [Baserow](https://baserow.io/)) is that the data you edit with Vizboard is not stored on our servers. 

Your data is where you want it to be, for instance on your own Gitlab server or on your Github organization.

So **Gitribute does not have its own backend server**, but relies only on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), or [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) servers and APIs to store your data where you put it originally. 

It means if you already have your own Gitlab account (or better, your own Gitlab instance), you won't have to rent a server for your database. Let your data be on Gitlab / Github / Mediawiki, those already do a lot : versionning, authentication, pull requests...

This way your data stays where it was, protected, and you can manage the incoming contributions as you would manage any "pull request".

## Contribute anonymously (if you feel a bit shy)

Gitribute uses the [tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) system provided by Github or Gitlab to "commit" and contribute to some data stored on one of those git providers.

To avoid asking to your grandpa' or your grandma' to create an account on those providers, and even worse to avoid asking them to create their own personal tokens, **Gitribute uses a default "ghost user token" (or your own)**.

If you want anonymous contribution onto your data with Vizboard, it is necessary to set your repo and related branches on Github or Gitlab for this "ghost user"'s actions (GET, PUT, POST). 

> **Note** : Basically you don't want this user's token to make "pushes" on your `main` branch for instance...

To sum up, when you set up your Vizboard widget from scratch you have to :

- 1/ Create your own "ghost user" / default token
- 2/ Set up the target repo to allow this token to make contributions (create branches, but not pushes directly to your `main` branch)
- 3/ You can inject this default token in the widget (either from an `.env` variable or directly from the frontend).

That way, an **user can push commits anonymously, without having to create its own Github or Gitlab account**. That said you can add a little message to the data owner to your anonymous contribution.

Users can also use their own token.

Your data on the `main` branch stays protected on your Git provider, and you - the dataset's owner - keep the control of who can write on it and on which branch.

It could seem like a bit of a hack, but the "ghost user" trick is not that much complicated.

It's like letting your grandpa' or grandma' use your Netflix account...
