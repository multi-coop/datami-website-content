### Change the language

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-CHANGE_LOCALE"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/vizboard-website-content/main/images/tutorial/commented/tutorial-09.png"
    />
</div>

As you can imagine the button <span class="icon"><i class="mdi mdi-translate"></i></span> can change the language used in the widget.

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-CHANGE_LOCALE-DIALOG"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/vizboard-website-content/main/images/tutorial/actions-language.png"
    />
</div>

For now only french and english are available in Datami, but we would be glad if you propose to help us translate Datami to other languages (anyone speaking German, or Turkish, or Spanish, or Italian, or Arabic, or any other language... ?).
