A "branch" selection dialog appears once you have saved your document, which you can activate by clicking on the <span class="icon"><i class="mdi mdi-source-branch"></i></span> button. It means your contribution proposal has been sent to the owner for the source file, but is not "merged" yet onto the source file.
