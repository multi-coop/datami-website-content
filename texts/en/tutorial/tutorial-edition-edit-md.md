An `md` (or markdown) file is the most simple type of document you can edit with Gitribute.

**You edit in the left side of the widget, and you see the result on the right side.**

Markdown is a very elegant [markup language created by Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and is quite a standard nowadays when it comes to work collaboratively on text. Markdown language includes only the necessary syntax to make it readable either by human and machines : bold/italic text, separators, text size, ... It's a very simple syntax to learn and very useful.

Many organizations uses "pads" (relying on Markdown language) to take notes collaboratively during meetings. Said "pads" can be provided by platforms like [Hackmd](hackmd.io/), [FramaPad](https://framapad.org) or [Hedgedocs](https://hedgedoc.org/), just to list some.

To learn more about the markdown syntax please[ check this ressource](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Editing an `md` file in Gitribute let you use the markdown syntax as you would usually do, so please write it as you want it and [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).
