#### "Preview" mode

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-PREVIEW_BUTTON"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/vizboard-website-content/main/images/tutorial/view-btn_preview.png"
    />
</div>

This is the default "edit-view" mode. It displays you the data as you edited it. If you don't have edited anything on the document yet, it shows you the source data as it is in the distant source file.

For instance the `preview` mode for a `json` file looks something like this :

<div style="border: thin solid lightgrey;">
  <img 
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-EDIT_PREVIEW"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/vizboard-website-content/main/images/tutorial/edition-preview-json.png"
    />
</div>
