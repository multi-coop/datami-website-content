### Copy the widget

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-COPY_WIDGET"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/vizboard-website-content/main/images/tutorial/commented/tutorial-08.png"
    />
</div>

The <span class="icon"><i class="mdi mdi-code-tags"></i></span> "copy widget's html" button is a quite useful button you will find on any Vizboard widget : it allows you to copy-paste the widget as a whole, so you could reuse it where you want.

Once you've clicked this button a dialog appears :

<div style="">
  <img
    alt="ACTIONS-COPY_WIDGET-DIALOG"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/vizboard-website-content/main/images/tutorial/actions-copy_result.png"
    />
</div>
 
The `html` code of the widget is copied to your clipboard. You can now paste the block in any html page you want to include the widget in any other `html` page (for instance in a Wordpress website).
