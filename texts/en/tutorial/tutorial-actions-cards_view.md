## The `cards` view

<div>

Some "view-modes" buttons are only available for table data, like the `cards` view.

If the widget is configured to allow the `cards` view, a table data file could be rendered as a list of cards.

You can still make the same actions of edition and diff views while in `cards` view.

For instance the `cards` view mode for a `csv` (table) file looks something like this :

<div style="border: thin solid lightgrey;">
  <img 
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-CARDS_VIEW"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/datami-website-content/main/images/tutorial/edition-preview-csv-cards.png"
    />
</div>
