By default Gitribute uses a "ghost user" token (like the account `multi-contributor` on Github), so you could contribute to a file without having to create an account.

The token is essential so you could "save" the changes you have made on the widget. This token is mandatory to make `POST` and `PUT` request to your Git provider's API.

But if you are familiar with Github or Gitlab (and if you already have an account on those) you can change the token to put your own. You just have to click on <span class="icon"><i class="mdi mdi-account"></i></span>  button, then click on the "Change" button and copy your own.
