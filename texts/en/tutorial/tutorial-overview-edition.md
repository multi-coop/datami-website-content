There are basic choices available in "edit" mode, we will refer to those choices as "edit-view" modes :

- **"Preview mode"** : preview of the document as you edit it ;
- **"Edit mode"** : view where you can edit the source document ;
- **"Diff mode"** : preview of the differences between the source document and your own modifications ;

Other features are quite useful but more specific to table files (like `csv`), for instance :

- **Show the external ressources**
- **Make a text search across the table**
- **Filter a table**
