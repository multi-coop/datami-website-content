Some action features are available globaly :

- **Show a file's infos**
- **Copy the widget's html code**
- **Manipulate the user options**
- **Switch between edit view modes**

Other features are quite useful but more specific to table files (like `csv`), for instance :

- **Switch between "table" and "cards" view**

> **Note** : More details about the actions features in the **["Tutorials > View document's informations"](/tutorial-actions)** section
