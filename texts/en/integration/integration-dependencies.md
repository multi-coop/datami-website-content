### Dependencies

Gitribute's widgets need several files and the widget's block in order to work correctly :

- `app.js` : the Vizboard application itself
- `app.css` : Vizboard's styles
- `materialdesignicons-webfont.woff2`: : Vizboard's icons
- and finally the widget's `html` block (`<multi-gitribute-file>`, `<multi-gitribute-multi-files>`, ...)

The `css` and `font` files are imported automatically, you just have to add the `script` and the widget's `html` block to integrate a widget to your page.

By clicking on the "copy-paste" button you will have those two blocks (`script` and `html`) immediately copied to your clipboard.
