## Adapt Vizboard for your website

We designed Vizboard in a way its widgets could be customized so you could use them to display your own data, the way you like it.

This documentation provides several examples of how a single Vizboard widget could be adapted to display any kind of data you want.

For instance the `<multi-gitribute-file>` widget alone can display several types of files : `csv`, `json`, `md`, `tsv`...

By changing the `gitfile` parameter in your `<multi-gitribute-file>` html block, and playing with the several options you will discover in the present documentation, you will be able to display the data you want...

It could seem a bit abstract here, but the documentation provides several examples and templates you can play with to see the results by yourself.

> **Note** : More details about the widgets parameters in the **["Documentation > Overview"](/docs-widgets-overview)** section.
