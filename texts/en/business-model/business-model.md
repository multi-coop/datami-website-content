Now we get a better understanding of the reasons the [tech cooperative multi](https://multi.coop) started the Gitribute project let's sum up, and focus on something you could legitimately ask us.

- Under a [GNU GPL v3 licence](/software) ;
- Free to use, extensively (we don't ask you to create an account nor to pay to use Gitribute) ;
- Without any proprietary backend in its code ;
- And finally - to add to the perplexity - developped by a private cooperative for which [external investment funding is more restrictive than other private companies](https://www.cairn.info/revue-des-sciences-de-gestion-2011-3-page-97.htm)...
