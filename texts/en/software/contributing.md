### Contribute to this website's source code

This website is powered by an open source app we developped at [multi](https://multi.coop), we called this solution **"[multi-site-app][repo_app]"** and you are as likely welcome to contribute to it.

This tool allows to generate an SPA (*Single Page App*) from a repository hosted on Github or Gilab containing :

- some configuration files ;
- markdown files for content ;
- images folder(s) ;
