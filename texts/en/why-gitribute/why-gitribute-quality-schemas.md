### Data & schemas

"_Schemas_" are a key stone to make open data more interoperable. To help public or private actors making their open data more reusable and more valueable, **sharing common referentials is vital**.

The French State has a strong roadmap regarding schemas, and there is already a good [list of schemas already existing](https://schema.data.gouv.fr/schemas.html) to create or analyze datasets.

Gitribute follows the trend of "[frictionless data](https://frictionlessdata.io/)" and some of Gitribute's widgets allow to **[apply table schema](/docs-gitfile)** to the tables you share in a widget.

Our intention with Gitribute is to allow actors with more modest means than a state (!) or big companies to use schemas.

If schemas are vital to make better open data, and if we want common citizen to produce open data, **using a schema upon a table should become trivial or transparent**.
