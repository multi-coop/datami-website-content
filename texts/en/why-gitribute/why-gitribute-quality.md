## ✨ · To plead for quality open data

Anyone who received datasets (a spreadsheet, a csv, a json...) in their mail knows the challenges in reusing - or even understanding - tables you didn't produce yourself.

Such data could come as either incomplete, not structured enough, some columns could be missing, some entries do not respect a referential, you'd need to geolocate your rows, etc... 

Delivered as such that kind of dataset is not "clean" nor ready for further uses.

With Datami we try to **adress this need for data consolidation**, mainly because this need for data consolidation is happening to us daily at work with evrey client we worked for : people's table data can always be "cleaner" or "better".

To consolidate data from Datami's widgets we mobilized two different families of tools : 

- **Schemas** : see below and [this section](/tutorial-edition#tutorial-edition-3-edition-csv-fields)
- **Third party APIs** : see below and [this other section](/tutorial-edition#tutorial-edition-5-edition-csv-consolidation_field)
