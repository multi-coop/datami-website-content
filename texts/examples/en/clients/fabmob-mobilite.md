As part of an exploratory mission with the Fabmob and in order to test the functionality of Datami allowing data to be requested from a mediawiki site, Multi has set up a Datami widget allowing information to be viewed on a family of projects hosted in the Fabmob wiki.

## Project Information

The FabMob is an association that brings together all the voluntary actors of mobility: territories, industrialists, research laboratories, start-ups, competitiveness clusters, universities and schools, agencies and ministries.

### Our observation

Mobility is the only sector whose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have increased compared to 1990 levels, unlike construction, agriculture or even industry. The trend has not reversed since the confinements linked to Covid: emissions have shown an estimated recovery of +11% between 2020 and 2021¹ then +7% between 2021 and 2022². It is also (and partly as a result) the leading source of GHG emissions in France, at around 30%³.

To achieve the objective of carbon neutrality in France by 2050, the transport sector would have to suffer the effects of Covid every year until 2030. Indeed, the objective established for the transport sector in the National Low Carbon Strategy 2 is to reduce emissions by 3-4 Mt eqCO2 per year over the period 2022-2030. But, if a reduction did indeed occur of the order of 4.5 Mt eqCO2 per year over the Covid period (2019-2021), it was only 0.7 Mt eqCO2 per year between 2015 and 2018⁴ .

It is therefore urgent to get down to producing real answers to the challenge of decarbonizing transport. But decarbonization does not come alone. The transition we are currently experiencing can only be thought of as a system. Not only is environmental justice intrinsically linked to social and territorial justice, but it depends on a virtuous conception of the digital environment in which we operate, and on an ability to question the mental models that motivate our actions.

Aware of these issues, the Fabrique des Mobilités participates, through its activities, in reducing the environmental impact of travel while promoting social and territorial inclusion. To do this, the Fabrique des Mobilités relies in particular on a digital of general interest and responsible as well as on a constant questioning of our representations.
