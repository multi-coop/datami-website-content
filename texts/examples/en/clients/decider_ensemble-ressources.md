The Décider Ensemble think tank brings together numerous resources concerning the various projects and initiatives that it has been able to follow since its creation.

This information is intended to be shared with the general public and updated regularly.

The multi-cooperative has set up Datami as a visualization solution for these resources, one of the needs being to be able to locate each of these initiatives on a map.

## Project Information

Spreading a culture of shared decision-making: this is the mission that the think tank Décider ensemble has given itself since 2005.

Through its initiatives, its work and its events, Décider ensemble has studied and identified many good practices in terms of citizen participation carried out throughout the territory by local authorities, associations, groups of citizens, businesses and the administration. . In order to publicize and disseminate these good practices, it was decided to bring them together on this platform. We hope that you will find many sources of inspiration there that will give everyone the desire to go further in the development of citizen participation but also to discuss these good practices with their peers.

The presentation sheets are accessible to all free of charge. The descriptive sheets are reserved for members of Decide together. For more information, write to us at contact@deciderensemble.com

### Where do the examples of participation approaches offered on this platform come from?

The winners of the Participation and Consultation Trophies: since 2016, Décider ensemble rewards each year the consultation actions carried out in the territories by various actors (local authorities, associations, companies, etc.). After a wide call for applications, the winners are chosen by an independent Jury made up of personalities from the world of participation. We invite you to find the winners of these Trophies on this platform.

The Barometer of digital local democracy: set up in 2016 and conducted since 2018 by the Observatory of civic tech & digital democracy of Decide together, its objective is to measure the practices and use of digital participation technologies within communities.

We invite you to find on this platform the digital approaches implemented by the communities studied as part of the Barometer.
