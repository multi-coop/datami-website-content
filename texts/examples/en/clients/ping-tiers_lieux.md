The popular digital education association PiNG identifies and updates a list of third places in Pays de la Loire. This mapping is a project in which the multi cooperative has been a partner for several years.

The multi-cooperative proposed and set up a Datami aimed at replacing the previous tool, thus providing better portability of visualizations and greater technical simplicity in the data update process.

## Project Information

The map of third places in Pays de la Loire, proposed by PiNG with the support of the Region and the National Agency for Territorial Cohesion, aims to show the dynamics of third places on the regional territory.

It thus makes it easier to identify the actors of the movement and to enhance the network of these places in the region.
It assumes the plurality of visions of the notion of third place of the actors at the head of networks on the subject (Association France Tiers-Lieux, CAP Tiers-Lieux and PiNG) by promoting their different data sets.
It offers a renewed classification of other third-place maps through its nomenclature, which highlights the transformative potential of these initiatives and thus goes beyond categorization by “type of space”.

It will allow you, we hope, to discover the richness of the third place movement in Pays de la Loire!

Happy wandering!

### Steps

Apparently simple, if we extract the technical aspects of such work, this mapping mission turned out to be more complex than it seemed, the very subject of this project referring to multiple visions.
Third places or the plurality of visions

The relevance of a concept is tested in its use, in that it makes it possible to show something that until then could not be seen, to understand what could not be understood. For our cartographic task, the difficulty posed to us by the term “third places” is that it covers a multiplicity of forms and realities that obey various logics (even sometimes contrary). By confronting ourselves with a wide range of definitions and typologies, we notice that the exercise is doomed to stumbling, each attempt concluding with the vagueness of the notion and proposing an inventory à la Prévert.

If the word "third places" has a strength, it is therefore not for its conceptual finesse, but on the contrary because it combines a set of places and initiatives arising at the crossroads of impactful dynamics for the conduct of Western societies “openness and collaboration, hybridization and innovation, the mixture of activities and leisure”1. From there stem its growing political use and the many fantasies it carries.

Therefore, by deepening our knowledge on the subject and related research, it did not seem possible (or even desirable) to establish a clear and precise definition of the term third places, which cannot be approached as a concept. This is why the cartographic work that we share to date is based on several sources (CAP Tiers-Lieux, PiNG, France Tiers-Lieux) up to date as of February 19, 20. These data reveal different visions of this dynamic which, if they do not oppose each other, they enrich and intersect and even question each other.
