Develop, propose and promote Low-technology.

We offer tools and methods useful for the development, manufacture and appropriation of Low-technology.

Low-tech, word for word low technology, designates a category of products, services, processes or other systems allowing, via a technical, organizational and cultural transformation, the development of new models of society integrating, in their principles fundamentals, the requirements of strong sustainability and collective resilience.

Low-tech is not a technophobic but a technocritical approach. In other words, even if it opposes the obsession with high-tech, it agrees with the principle of techno-discernment.
