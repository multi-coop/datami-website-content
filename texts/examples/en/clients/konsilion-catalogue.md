The use of Datami by the Konsilion project is among the first entirely free uses of Datami.

The Konsilion project uses Datmai not only as an open source solution to visualize the different sections of its resource center, but also uses Datami as an "off-the-shelf" widget. Indeed Konsilion uses Datami directly as a widget type application, and did not have to deploy our code to benefit from its functionalities.

## Project Information

Konsilion aims to develop, offer and promote Low-technology. We offer tools and methods useful for the development, manufacture and appropriation of Low-technology.

Low-tech, word for word low technology, designates a category of products, services, processes or other systems allowing, via a technical, organizational and cultural transformation, the development of new models of society integrating, in their principles fundamentals, the requirements of strong sustainability and collective resilience.

Low-tech is not a technophobic but a technocritical approach. In other words, even if it opposes the obsession with high-tech, it agrees with the principle of techno-discernment.
