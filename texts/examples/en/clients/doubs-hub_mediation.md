Do you have difficulties with digital? To carry out an administrative procedure, request a car registration document, consult your CAF rights or declare your income...? Don't have a computer or internet connection at home? Can't figure out how to apply for RSA or Housing Benefit?

The Department of Doubs provides you with this tool, a map to help you find help near you; in town halls, associations, Maisons France Services in your department; closer to your home.

Thanks to this map, you will be able to locate the places, the services offered, the schedules of these structures.

The content of this card will be brought to evolve regularly to take into account all the changes which will be communicated to us. It is thanks to you that it will be updated as closely as possible to developments. If you spot any errors, changes in opening hours, if you are informed of the opening of a new structure, do not hesitate to let us know by sending us an email to the following address: sdin @doubs.fr
