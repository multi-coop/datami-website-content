The department of Doubs carries out a census of the places of digital inclusion on its territory, Datami makes it possible to visualize them simply and to make these data inteeligible for a wide audience.

During the realization of this cartography, the multi cooperative was able to make Datami evolve by allowing for example a better differentiation of the mapped places, by allowing to associate with each geo-point a color according to the legal category of the place.
