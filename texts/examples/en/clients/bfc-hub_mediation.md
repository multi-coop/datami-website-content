Digital mediation places are shared spaces that adapt to new expectations, practices and technologies and are part of the same approach: to encourage encounters and exchanges between people, interests and skills, who are not necessarily intended to cross.

These places all have a common objective, but each has its particularity in its operation and its services offered.

MedNum BFC lists the places of digital mediation in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. These places are mapped, posted online and accessible to everyone.

## Online mapping for what?

It thus makes it possible to promote the meshing of the network of digital mediation actors, to facilitate the orientation of the various publics towards the appropriate structures and to increase the visibility of digital mediation actors at the regional level.

The challenge is also that of territorial management, the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the territory, the pooling of equipment, ...

## What's in there?

The contact details of the structures listed, whether they are totally dedicated to digital or not, their service offers, opening hours, the type of equipment that can be found there, pricing.

## Mapping for whom?

For those looking for a place to train in digital uses, have access to an internet connection, equipment (computers, printers, scanner, 3 D printer, etc.)

For those who guide people who are far from digital (through the use of or access to equipment): social centres, town halls, social workers, integration counsellors, etc. on the appropriate structures.

For digital mediation structures who wish to know the digital mediation network in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, exchange practices, pool their skills, know-how, materials, collaborate on collective projects...

## Up-to-date data

It is a tool at the service of digital mediation actors and a map only makes sense if the information present therein is up-to-date. You are therefore invited to contribute to its updating and operation, by accessing the online form to declare your place of digital mediation or update the information concerning it.
