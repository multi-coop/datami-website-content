In an exploratory approach and in order to test the functionality of Datami allowing to request data from a mediawiki site, Multi has set up a Datami widget allowing to visualize the information on the projects hosted in the Call For Commons wiki.

## Project Information

The role of the Call for Commons is to bring together all voluntary actors to produce open resources - the commons - and thus develop the resilience of territories in a logic of adaptation to climate change by creating and sharing these commons. .

We consider that in the digital age, it is necessary to connect resilience actors in order to build common resources together: technological platforms, open data, free software, knowledge, feedback, protocols, territories of experimentation...

This Call for Commons is initiated, designed and launched by ADEME, in particular based on the experience of the Factories (Mobility, Logistics, Energy). Management is provided by ADEME (Elodie Briche from the Towns and Territories Planning division and Gabriel Plassat from the Transport and Mobility Department). An external consulting team specializing in legal aspects, licenses, organization of a community, commons and open source will support the bearers of commons. To discuss with the organizers and the consulting team, this link to the discussion forum.

The ANCT (Marie Bernard) and the AFD (Jean Millerat) are involved as observers interested in both the subject of Resilience and the principle of Call for Commons to possibly draw inspiration from it in their organisations.
