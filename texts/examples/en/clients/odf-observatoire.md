The multi cooperative is one of the historic partners of the Open Data France association. The Open Data Observatory is one of the projects that we are helping to advance and which is close to our hearts, because it is the benchmark in France for the state of open data throughout the country.

On the basis of a register updated regularly by Open Data France, the multi cooperative has produced several tools allowing the consolidation and visualization of this data set. In particular, we have produced various scripts allowing the semi-automatic updating of the exposed data, and set up Datami as a visualization and interactive mapping tool for general public use.

## Project Information

The Open Data Observatory makes it possible to know and better understand the progress of the opening of public data in the territories. The Observatory is a tool for steering the digital public policies of local authorities.

### The project

A semi-automatic collection platform for all data published by local authorities. Multi-channel processing and restitution tools.

### The method

The data comes from a collection process that is as automated as possible. When necessary, information is entered manually.

To improve and facilitate this enrichment, a contribution interface is offered in the Observatory. Processing and implementation planning are described in the Methodology page.

### Indicators and results

The indicators developed allow a detailed understanding of the dynamics of openness to data. They are interested in the quantitative and qualitative dimension of open data in the territories. They also deal with the impacts of open data: reuse, animation and territorial cooperation. The indicators are all the data collected and produced are accessible for consultation and download
