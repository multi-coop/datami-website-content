The multi cooperative, in collaboration with Mednum, has been commissioned to work on a feasibility study concerning the creation of a "parenting digital fragility index".

As part of this mission, the multi cooperative worked to aggregate different sources of data relating to issues of education and digital fragility on a first sample of municipalities and departments, with the aim of being able to generate the various indicators necessary for the production of this digital parenthood fragility index.

We used Datami as a visualization tool for this new data. This mission also allowed us to develop Datami by providing new features in terms of cartography, in particular with regard to the implementation of several configurable choropleth layers on the same map.
