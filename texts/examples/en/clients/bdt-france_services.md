During a mission in cooperation with the Mednum, the multi cooperative had the task of generating different indicators by crossing different sources of data concerning France Services, establishment by establishment.

The Mednum was responsible for supporting the Banque des Territoires in defining the various indicators to be put in place. The multi cooperative then carried out data processing on a sample of 200 France Services in order to test the validity of the calculations as well as the availability of the data.

The multi cooperative proceeded to visualize this data using Datami, on the basis of models of intent provided by Mednum and the Banque des Territoires.

This mission also made it possible to develop new functionalities, such as the possibility of integrating data visualizations directly into the detailed sheets as well as the possibility of pointing directly to a detailed sheet with a simple url.
