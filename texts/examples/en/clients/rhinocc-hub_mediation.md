The Network and Hub for Digital Inclusion in Occitanie (RhinOcc) is a support system for actors on digital inclusion approaches led by the association La Mêlée, deployed and coordinated with its partners. RhinOcc has set up an interactive map of places of digital inclusion in Occitanie for its users.

Aimed at professionals, RhinOcc's mapping facilitates the identification of digital and social actors and the places in which they carry out activities relating to digital inclusion (computer workshops, support for access to dematerialized rights, computer self-service, professional training in digital professions, etc.)

The mapping of places of digital inclusion in Occitania is a project in which the multi cooperative has been a partner for several years.
The challenge then was to offer a visualization and mapping tool for this data, with an economical tool, suitable for the general public, and allowing the data from the census to be updated. A first free tool (Apiviz) had been set up to generate these visualizations and this cartography;

The multi-cooperative proposed and set up a Datami aimed at replacing the previous tool, thus providing better portability of visualizations and greater technical simplicity in the data update process.

## Project Information

The RhinOcc, Network and Hub for Digital Inclusion in Occitania, is one of the 11 Hubs for digital inclusion in France, driven by the Banque des Territoires in partnership with the Mission Société Numérique as part of the National Strategy for Digital Inclusion of the State Secretariat for Digital Affairs.

### The project

The project is led by La Mêlée in partnership with Coll.in, in collaboration with Envoi Insertion et Handicap, La Compagnie du Code and La Mêlée Adour.

We have the following objectives:

- to set up a territorial support structure for digital inclusion players in Occitanie (Aude, Gers, Haute-Garonne, Hautes-Pyrénées)
- to associate and network public, private and associative actors in order to structure, create and support a digital mediation offer in line with the specificities and needs of the territories, and this in a sustainable manner

### Why a Hub for inclusive digital?

#### Context and findings

13 million French people far from digital: 19.5% of the French population
The massive digitization / dematerialization of services is accelerating and further widens the inequalities of citizens and all the more to the disadvantage of vulnerable populations (seniors, non-graduates, inhabitants of priority neighborhoods, disabled people, long-term job seekers, etc.) and on all aspects of life (health, finance, mobility, work, administrative procedures, etc.)

A digital mediation ecosystem that is currently poorly structured and in which it is difficult to find one's bearings:
Each actor is faced with support for digital uses: social actors, associations, institutions, companies, etc.

New players on a national scale with whom we have to deal (Emmaus Connect, Simplon, etc.) and committed players in the field who lack visibility and skills who need to be supported
The State and the Banque des Territoires are reinvesting in the subject from the angle of digital inclusion by launching actions and programs in the territories (Grande École du Numérique, Helpants Connect, the Territorial Hubs for inclusive digital technology, the Digital Pass , etc.)

#### A simple definition of digital inclusion

Digital inclusion is a process that aims to make digital a lever accessible to the public, thanks to support and the transmission of skills, in order to promote their autonomy and their social and economic integration.
