The RhinOcc, Network and Hub for Digital Inclusion in Occitania, is one of the 11 Hubs for digital inclusion in France, driven by the Banque des Territoires in partnership with the Mission Société Numérique as part of the National Strategy for Digital Inclusion of the State Secretariat for Digital Affairs.

## The project

The project is led by La Mêlée in partnership with Coll.in, in collaboration with Envoi Insertion et Handicap, La Compagnie du Code and La Mêlée Adour.

We have the following objectives:

- to set up a territorial support structure for digital inclusion players in Occitanie (Aude, Gers, Haute-Garonne, Hautes-Pyrénées)
- to associate and network public, private and associative actors in order to structure, create and support a digital mediation offer in line with the specificities and needs of the territories, and this in a sustainable manner

## Why a Hub for inclusive digital?

### Context and findings

13 million French people far from digital: 19.5% of the French population
The massive digitization / dematerialization of services is accelerating and further widens the inequalities of citizens and all the more to the disadvantage of vulnerable populations (seniors, non-graduates, inhabitants of priority neighborhoods, disabled people, long-term job seekers, etc.) and on all aspects of life (health, finance, mobility, work, administrative procedures, etc.)

A digital mediation ecosystem that is currently poorly structured and in which it is difficult to find one's bearings:
Each actor is faced with support for digital uses: social actors, associations, institutions, companies, etc.

New players on a national scale with whom we have to deal (Emmaus Connect, Simplon, etc.) and committed players in the field who lack visibility and skills who need to be supported
The State and the Banque des Territoires are reinvesting in the subject from the angle of digital inclusion by launching actions and programs in the territories (Grande École du Numérique, Helpants Connect, the Territorial Hubs for inclusive digital technology, the Digital Pass , etc.)


### A simple definition of digital inclusion

Digital inclusion is a process that aims to make digital a lever accessible to the public, thanks to support and the transmission of skills, in order to promote their autonomy and their social and economic integration.
