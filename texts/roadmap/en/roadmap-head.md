# Roadmap

Datami is a project currently in a early phase stage of developments. So far we have put in place most of its core features, such as providing customazible frontend web components, the ability to dialog with Gitlab’s / Github’s / mediawiki’s APIs to retrieve data and send contributions, and its ability to associate data models to open datasets.

**That said some remaining core features are still in need to be developped to make Datami fulfill its complete scope of promises.**

We identified several milestones corresponding to the missing core features remaining to develop to make Datami fully responding to users’ needs.

If you wish to propose new features or report issues do not hesitate to let us know by sending us an email to contact@multi.coop
